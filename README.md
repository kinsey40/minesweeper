## Potential Addtional Features
There are two particular features that the author has not added that the author believes could be greatly beneficial.
Firstly, on the 'Game Settings' page, a link that opens a window with instructions of how to play minesweeper would be beneficial. 
Secondly, in the online version of minesweeper, they include a feature whereby, pressing the mouse on any of the 'buttons' it 'sinks' that button and the surrounding buttons. 

## Comments and Improvements
The author welcomes comments and improvements. I am fairly new to programming,so welcome any feedback on the approach and any ways to improve the code. Also, feel free to clone the repository and edit the features yourself. Thanks :)
